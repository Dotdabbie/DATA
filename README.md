# Recommendation
My Recommendations Based on Sales Analysis are:

- Focus Marketing Efforts on PARTS:

Since PART is the top-selling product and contributes significantly to revenue, particularly boosted by salesacross the different region between 2014 and 2015, consider increasing marketing and promotional activities in this area particularly in north central region with lesser revenue.

- sales fluctuations of different market across the year 2014 and 2015 can be stabilized with customers satisfactory and feedback surveys. Regularly review sales data to detect emerging trends or shifts in customer behavior. Agile response to changing dynamics can help maintain and potentially grow sales performance across regions and products. Consider launching loyalty programs or customer feedback initiatives to deepen customer relationships and gather actionable insights for further product or service improvements.

# Conclusion:
Following the analysis, strategic teams shows be in place to curtail the reduced sales in stores like CHIBOK and also monitors startups and changes in each market across each region.
